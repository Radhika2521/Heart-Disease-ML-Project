# Heart-Disease-ML-Project

Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patients' medical attributes.

Utilized libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis and Scikit-Learn for modelling

Performed hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to evaluate and optimize three models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.

Generated predictions using models with optimized hyperparameters.
